PREV NOTES
- Add more data structures and algorithms and declare and implement them and their related functions in include/dsa.h and also add functionality in src/dsa.cpp
- Update build.sh whenever a file is created.

TASKS:
TREE
1. implement the binary search tree or avl tree (the linked list rn) .
2. migrate the active file data from the temporary linked list to the new permanent tree structure. retain linked list.
3. code tree operations -> search, insert, delete

INTEGRATION
4. finalize the filemanager class by adding tree + stack as private members.
5. implement core methods in class:
    a. logicaldelete -> search tree, mark file as 'deleted', push its metadata onto stack.
    b. recoverlastfile -> pop the file from the stack and simulate the 'recovered' file output.
6. fix file struct in datastructures.h to include a unique key (e.g. an id/timestamp) for tree sorting.
7. make menu to perform these -> 'delete', 'recover', 'list', 'quit'
